AI systems are evolving fast, and one of the most exciting shifts happening right now is the rise of AI agents—models that can plan, reason, use tools, and take actions to accomplish complex goals. Unlike traditional chatbots that simply respond to a prompt, agents behave more like collaborators, capable of breaking tasks into steps, reflecting on their progress, and even working together as teams. This article explores how these agent architectures work, what we’ve learned from recent research, and why agents are quickly becoming the foundation of the next generation of AI applications.

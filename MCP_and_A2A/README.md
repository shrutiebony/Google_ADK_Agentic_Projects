## MCP and A2A Codelab Assignment

This repository contains the implementation and deliverables for **three Google Codelabs** focusing on:
- **ADK (Agent Development Kit)**
- **MCP (Message Communication Protocol)**
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** communication

These codelabs collectively demonstrate how to **create, deploy, and manage multi-agent systems** using the **Google Agent Engine** and **A2A Action Engine**.

##### Overview

The project demonstrates hands-on experience with:
- Building **autonomous agents** using Google’s **ADK (Agent Development Kit)**
- Establishing **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)** communication channels
- Implementing **MCP (Message Communication Protocol)** for reliable agent messaging
- Using the **A2A Action Engine** for orchestration and action-based workflows

Each codelab directory includes:
- Source code and configuration files  
- Execution logs, results, and screenshots  
- A short documentation on architecture and workflow

##### Codelabs Included

##### **Codelab 1 – Multi-Agent System with ADK and A2A Protocol**

**Objective:**  
Build and deploy a multi-agent system using the **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and enable **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** communication through the Agent Engine.

**Key Concepts:**
- Multi-Agent System Architecture  
- ADK setup and registration  
- A2A communication initialization and verification  

**Artifacts:**
- `agents/` – agent configuration files  
- `src/` – source code for deployed agents  
- `logs/` – execution and deployment logs  
- `screenshots/` – proof of execution

##### **Codelab 2 – Getting Started with ADK, MCP, and A2A**

**Objective:**  
Learn to implement **MCP (Message Communication Protocol)** for agent-based communication and create a simple **Currency Exchange Agent**.

**Key Concepts:**
- Understanding the MCP messaging lifecycle  
- Building a basic Currency Exchange agent  
- Integrating MCP with ADK and A2A  

**Artifacts:**
- `CurrencyAgent/` – source code and configuration  
- `execution_logs/` – message exchange logs  
- `screenshots/` – message flow and execution proof

##### **Codelab 3 – Getting Started with A2A Action Engine**

**Objective:**  
Implement a **Purchasing Concierge** using the **A2A Action Engine**, simulating intelligent decision-making and inter-agent task orchestration.

**Key Concepts:**
- A2A Action Engine fundamentals  
- Action request and response cycles  
- Multi-agent collaboration and task handling  

**Artifacts:**
- `action_definitions/` – A2A action definitions  
- `src/` – concierge and task agents  
- `results/` – test logs and performance outputs
